    "description": "In Type Help, you'll find yourself facing an old laptop's command-line interface, filled with hidden files waiting to be discovered. The game's distinctive mechanic revolves around deducing correct file names, which follow a specific pattern like '02-EN-1-6-7-10'. Each element of these filenames holds crucial meaning: time sequences, location codes, and character identifiers. Success in Type Help requires careful attention to dialogue details, strategic thinking, and methodical investigation. As you unlock more files through correct name deduction, you'll gradually reconstruct the events that led to the tragedy at Galley House. This unique approach transforms traditional puzzle-solving into an engaging detective experience where every correctly guessed filename brings you closer to the truth.",
